Open Sourced HTML filtering utility for Java

    Front page: http://finn-no.github.com/xss-html-filter

This utility is a single class, HTMLFilter, which can be used to parse user-submitted input and sanitize it against potential cross site scripting attacks, malicious html, or simply badly formed html. This version, written in Java, is largely a translation of
lib_filter ( http://code.iamcal.com/php/lib_filter/ ), the original work of Cal Henderson ( http://www.iamcal.com/ ) written in PHP.


Processing HTML Input

Sample usage:

    // retrieve input from user...
    String input = ...
    String clean = new HTMLInputFilter().filter( input );

There's also an example using constretto: https://github.com/michaelsembwever/xss-html-filter/wiki/Using-Constretto
